# change_config_file
this program is useful for change and delete config file in linux

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This program works as follows:
All files are in a folder named project
The names of all files are separated by the IP character
An action field must be changed in all files. This is done by this script.

You can ask us for free so that we can design a script for you at such times :-)
